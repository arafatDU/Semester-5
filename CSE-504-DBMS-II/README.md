## üîç Query Optimization & Processing

### Topics Covered:
- **Parsing & Translation**: Converting SQL queries into internal representations using syntax trees.
- **Query Optimization**: Techniques for improving query execution plans using heuristics and cost-based methods.
- **Evaluation**: Methods to evaluate and execute optimized queries efficiently.

### Key Concepts:
- Logical & Physical Query Plans

## üîÅ Transactions & Serializability

### Topics Covered:
- **Dependency Graphs**
- **Conflict Serializability**
- **Precedence Graphs**

### Process:
1. **From Transaction Table to Graph**: Create edges based on read/write conflicts.
2. **Cycle Detection**:
   - If **no cycle**: Conflict Serializable ‚úÖ
   - If **cycle found**: Not Conflict Serializable ‚ùå

### Key Concepts:
- Schedule
- Serial vs. Serializable
- Read-Write, Write-Read, Write-Write Conflicts

---

## üîÅ Recovery System

### Topics Covered:
- **Undo/Redo Mechanism**
- **Recovery Techniques** using logs

### Process:
- Apply **UNDO** for uncommitted transactions
- Apply **REDO** for committed transactions after crash

### Key Concepts:
- Checkpoints
- Log Records (Before/After Images)

## üõí Apriori Algorithm

### Topics Covered:
- **Frequent Itemset Mining**
- **From C1 ‚Üí L1 ‚Üí C2 ‚Üí L2 ‚Üí ...**
- **Support and Confidence**
- **Subset Pruning**

### Process:
1. Count frequency of itemsets.
2. Prune non-frequent itemsets.
3. Use Apriori property: All subsets of a frequent itemset must also be frequent.

### Key Concepts:
- Support Threshold
- Confidence Threshold
- Association Rules

## üå≥ Decision Tree

### Topics Covered:
- **Entropy Calculation**
- **Information Gain**
- **Attribute Selection Based on Gain**

### Process:
1. Calculate entropy of dataset.
2. For each attribute, calculate expected entropy.
3. Select attribute with highest information gain to split.

### Key Concepts:
- Root Node ‚Üí Leaf Nodes
- ID3 Algorithm
- Overfitting and Pruning

## üß† Naive Bayes Classifier

### Topics Covered:
- **Prior Probability**: Probability of class without evidence.
- **Conditional Probability**: Given feature, what's the class probability?

### Process:
- Use Bayes‚Äô Theorem:
  \[
  P(Class | Feature) = \frac{P(Feature | Class) \cdot P(Class)}{P(Feature)}
  \]
- Multiply conditional probabilities across features.

### Key Concepts:
- Independence Assumption
- Class Prediction via Maximum Posterior

- **Comparison with**:
  - **R-Tree**: Spatial access method for rectangles/regions.
  - **B-Tree**: Balanced tree for indexing and range queries.

### Key Differences:

| Feature         | B-Tree        | R-Tree        | Kd-Tree       |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Data Type      | 1D            | Spatial       | Multi-Dimensional |
| Use Case       | Indexing      | GIS, Images   | Nearest Neighbor |
| Balance        | Yes           | Yes           | No (depends on split) |

2. Pick **K closest points**.
3. Classify based on majority vote (for classification) or average (for regression).

### Key Concepts:
- Euclidean Distance
- Choice of K
- Curse of Dimensionality
